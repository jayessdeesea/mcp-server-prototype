# Filesystem MCP Server Tools

The Filesystem MCP Server does not currently provide any tools. It only provides resources for accessing file metadata and content.

## Understanding MCP Tools

In the Model Context Protocol (MCP), tools represent executable functionality that can perform actions or computations. Unlike resources, which provide data, tools can modify state or interact with external systems.

Tools in MCP have:
- A unique name
- A description
- An input schema (defining the parameters they accept)
- A response format

## Future Tools

In future versions, the server may provide tools for:

### File Management Tools

| Tool Name | Description | Parameters |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| `create_file` | Create a new file | `path`: Path where the file should be created<br>`content`: Content to write to the file |
| `create_directory` | Create a new directory | `path`: Path where the directory should be created |
| `delete_file` | Delete a file | `path`: Path to the file to delete |
| `delete_directory` | Delete a directory | `path`: Path to the directory to delete<br>`recursive`: Whether to delete recursively |
| `copy_file` | Copy a file | `source`: Path to the source file<br>`destination`: Path to the destination |
| `move_file` | Move or rename a file | `source`: Path to the source file<br>`destination`: Path to the destination |

### File Search Tools

| Tool Name | Description | Parameters |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| `search_files` | Search for files matching criteria | `directory`: Directory to search in<br>`pattern`: Glob pattern to match<br>`recursive`: Whether to search recursively |
| `find_text` | Find files containing text | `directory`: Directory to search in<br>`text`: Text to search for<br>`recursive`: Whether to search recursively |

### File Monitoring Tools

| Tool Name | Description | Parameters |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| `watch_file` | Watch a file for changes | `path`: Path to the file to watch<br>`duration`: How long to watch (in seconds) |
| `watch_directory` | Watch a directory for changes | `path`: Path to the directory to watch<br>`duration`: How long to watch (in seconds) |

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing tools, the server will need to:

1. Register tool definitions with input schemas
2. Implement tool handlers that process requests
3. Ensure proper error handling and validation
4. Provide comprehensive logging
5. Implement appropriate security measures

Tools will be implemented following the MCP SDK patterns and best practices, adhering to SOLID principles and maintaining separation of concerns.
