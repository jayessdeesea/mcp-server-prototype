# Filesystem MCP Server Prompts

The Filesystem MCP Server does not currently provide any prompts. It only provides resources for accessing file metadata and content.

## Understanding MCP Prompts

In the Model Context Protocol (MCP), prompts are pre-defined templates or instructions that help guide AI models in generating specific types of content or performing specific tasks. Prompts in MCP can:

- Provide structured guidance for AI models
- Include placeholders for dynamic content
- Be parameterized to customize behavior
- Contain system instructions and context

Prompts differ from tools and resources in that they don't execute code or return data directly - instead, they provide instructions that help the AI model generate more accurate, relevant, and useful responses.

## Future Prompts

In future versions, the server may provide prompts for:

### File Operation Prompts

| Prompt Name | Description | Parameters |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| `suggest_file_operations` | Suggest file operations based on context | `path`: Path to analyze<br>`context`: Additional context about the user's goals |
| `explain_file_structure` | Explain the structure of a directory | `path`: Path to the directory<br>`detail_level`: How detailed the explanation should be |

### File Navigation Prompts

| Prompt Name | Description | Parameters |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| `navigate_directory` | Provide guidance for navigating a directory structure | `current_path`: Current location<br>`target`: Description of what the user is looking for |
| `find_similar_files` | Help find files similar to a reference file | `reference_file`: Path to the reference file<br>`search_directory`: Where to look for similar files |

### Content Generation Prompts

| Prompt Name | Description | Parameters |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| `generate_file_template` | Generate a template for a new file | `file_type`: Type of file to generate (e.g., "java", "html")<br>`purpose`: Purpose of the file |
| `suggest_file_improvements` | Suggest improvements for a file | `file_path`: Path to the file<br>`improvement_type`: Type of improvements to suggest (e.g., "performance", "readability") |

### Content Analysis Prompts

| Prompt Name | Description | Parameters |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| `analyze_code_file` | Analyze a code file and provide insights | `file_path`: Path to the code file<br>`analysis_type`: Type of analysis to perform |
| `summarize_directory_contents` | Summarize the contents of a directory | `directory_path`: Path to the directory<br>`include_subdirectories`: Whether to include subdirectories |

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing prompts, the server will need to:

1. Design effective prompt templates that guide the AI model
2. Ensure prompts are parameterized appropriately
3. Provide clear documentation on how to use each prompt
4. Balance between providing enough guidance and allowing flexibility
5. Test prompts with various inputs to ensure they produce useful results

Prompts will be implemented following best practices for prompt engineering, ensuring they are clear, specific, and effective at guiding the AI model to produce useful responses.
